# **Saniru Wick's** Stats220 Repository.

This repository is going to contain my work and projects from Stats220, my first step into R coding! ðŸ™Œ.
I want to use this repository to showcase the work in this class and show my improvement when I'm doing future projects.

*What I aim to achieve through this course:*
  1. Getting used to working on GitHub and its community and features.
  2. Get started on a GitHub website, which I plan to use as a portfolio for this class and others.
  3. Develop my R knowledge.
